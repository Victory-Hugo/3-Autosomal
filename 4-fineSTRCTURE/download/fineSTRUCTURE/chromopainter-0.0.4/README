1. REQUIREMENTS

Assuming that you are in a Linux environment, you need:
1. an up-to-date version of the gcc compiler, e.g. "gcc (Ubuntu 4.4.3-4ubuntu5) 4.4.3"
2. Zlib zip library (package zlib1g-dev in ubuntu)

There are probably other requirements which are present on most systems by default.  If you encounter any problems let us know.  An up-to-date list of all requirements will be maintained on www.paintmychromosomes.com "ChromoPainter Download" page.

2. INSTALLATION

Briefly:

./configure
make
make install #optional

More details are in the INSTALL file.
