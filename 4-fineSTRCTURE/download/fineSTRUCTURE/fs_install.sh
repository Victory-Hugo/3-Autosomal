## This file just puts a running version of fs into your PATH. You can do this manually if you know what you are doing.

## Detect shell

	mkdir -p $HOME/bin
	cp fs $HOME/bin/

	export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/bin"

	test=`grep '$HOME/bin' $HOME/.bashrc  | grep PATH  | grep -v ' ยง#' | wc -l`

Make sure to look at the examples in this folder!"

	else
